# Assignment 2
### Data Wrangling and Visualization

In Assignment 2 we will be practicing data manipulation including use of the tidyverse.

The instructions to Assignment 2 are in the Assignment 2-2020.rmd file. Assignments are structured in three parts, in the first part you can just follow along with the code, in the second part you will need to apply the code, and in the third part is completely freestyle and you are expected to apply your new knowledge in a new way. 

**Please complete as much as you can by midnight EDT, 10/05/20**

Once you have finished, commit, push and pull your assignment back to the main branch. Include both the .Rmd file and the .html file.

Good luck!
