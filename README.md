# Data Manipulation Project
### Data Wrangling and Visualization

In this project, we will be practicing data manipulation including use of the tidyverse.

The final work are in the data manipulation.rmd file. The work is divided in to three different parts based on its structure. In the first part there are examples to show you how to construct the code, which you may follow along with the code to have an idea of it. In the second part you will need to apply what you learned in the first part, and answer the respective questions. In the last part you are completely free of how you answer the questions. It could be what you learned in the first part, or it could also be knowledges from outside research.

Once it is finished, commit, push and pull the data manipulation project back to the main branch.

Good luck!
