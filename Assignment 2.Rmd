##Part I & II

```{r}
#load packages
library(igraph)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(base)

#install data
D1 <- read_csv("discipline-data.csv")
D1$stid <- as.factor(D1$stid)
#isolate variables within D2
D2 <- dplyr::select(D1, tid, stid)
#collapse into single row and show how many times teacher-student pairs appear
EDGE <- dplyr::count(D2, tid, stid)
names(EDGE) <- c("from", "to", "count")
#make the vertex list of all the teachers and students and their characteristics in our network
#seperate teachers
V.TCH <- dplyr::select(D1, tid, t.gender, t.expertise)
#Remove all the repeats so that we just have a list of each teacher and their characteristics
V.TCH <- unique(V.TCH)
#Add a variable that describes that they are teachers
V.TCH$group <- "teacher"

#Now repeat this process for the students
V.STD <- dplyr::select(D1, stid, s.gender, s.major)
V.STD <- unique(V.STD)
V.STD$group <- "student"

#Make sure that the student and teacher data frames have the same variables names
names(V.TCH) <- c("id", "gender", "topic", "group")
names(V.STD) <- c("id", "gender", "topic", "group")

#Bind the two data frames together (you will get a warning because the teacher data frame has 5 types of id (A,B,C,D,E) and the student has 25 (1-30), this isn't a problem)
VERTEX <- dplyr::bind_rows(V.TCH, V.STD)

```
```{r}
#First we will make an object that contains the graph information using our two dataframes EDGE and VERTEX. Notice that we have made "directed = TRUE" - our graph is directed since discipline is being given from a teacher to a student.

g <- graph.data.frame(EDGE, directed=TRUE, vertices=VERTEX)

#Now we can plot our graph using the force directed graphing technique - our old friend Fruchertman-Reingold!

plot(g,layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold)

#There are many ways to change the attributes of the graph to represent different characteristics of the newtork. For example, we can color the nodes according to gender.
gender_color <- ifelse(VERTEX$gender == "female", "lightblue", "orange")
plot(g,layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold, vertex.color=gender_color)

#We can change the thickness of the edge according to the number of times a particular teacher has sent a particular student to the principal.

plot(g,layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold, vertex.color=gender_color, edge.width=EDGE$count)

V(g)$vertex_degree <-  degree(g)


#change verticies size based on student vertices in terms of the number of disciplinary actions they have recieved
plot(g,layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold, vertex.color=gender_color, edge.width=EDGE$count,
     vertex.size=V(g)$vertex_degree)

```
##Part III
###Data Cleaning 
```{r}
#import class data
D3 <- read_csv("HUDK4050-2018-classes.csv")
#filter relevant variables
D3 <- unite(D3, "Name", c(Q8, Q9), sep=" ")
D4 <- dplyr::select(D3, Name, Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7)
D4 <- D4[-c(1, 2, 3, 39), ]
#fix rows with no space between dept and course number
D4[3,3] = "HUDK 5035"
D4[3,4] = "HUDK 4011"
D4[3,5] = "HUDM 4125"
D4[3,2] = "HUDK 4050"
D4[4,3] = "MSTU 5003"
D4[4,4] = "MSTU 4083"
D4[4,5] = "MSTU 4039"
D4[4,6] = "MSTU 4000"
D4[36,2] = "HUDK 4050"
D4[36,3] = "EDPA 6002"
#gather
D4G <- gather(D4, Class, Count, -1)
colnames(D4G) <- c("Name", "Count", "Class")
D4G$Count <- 1
#spread so class is in column with 0 or 1 indicating if student is enrolled
#change NA to 0  
D4G <- na.omit(D4G)
#change string to 0s 
D5 <- spread(D4G, Class, Count)
#remove second and last columns
D5[-1] <- lapply(D5[-1], function(x) as.integer(x!="0"))
D5[is.na(D5)] <- 0 
D5 <- D5[,-19]
```

###Clustering and Social Network Analysis
```{r}
library(klaR)
#cluster
fit <- kmodes(D5, 4, iter.max = 10, weighted = FALSE)

#change names to index
row.names(D5) <- D5$Name
#remove name column 
D5$Name <- NULL
#convert to matrix
m1 <- as.matrix(D5)
m2 <- m1 %*% t(m1)
diag(m2) <-0
plot(graph_from_adjacency_matrix(m2, mode="undirected", weighted=NULL, diag =TRUE), layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold, vertex.color=fit$cluster)
```
