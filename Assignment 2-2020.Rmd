#Part I

## Data Wrangling
In the hackathon a project was proposed to collect data from student video watching, a sample of this data is available in the file video-data.csv.

stid = student id
year = year student watched video
participation = whether or not the student opened the video
watch.time = how long the student watched the video for
confusion.points = how many times a student rewatched a section of a video
key,points = how many times a student skipped or increased the speed of a video

```{r}
#Install the 'tidyverse' package or if that does not work, install the 'dplyr' and 'tidyr' packages.

#Load the package(s) you just installed

library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

D1 <- read.csv("video-data.csv", header = TRUE)

#Create a data frame that only contains the years 2018
D2 <- filter(D1, year == 2018)
```

## Histograms
```{r}
#Generate a histogram of the watch time for the year 2018

hist(D2$watch.time)

#Change the number of breaks to 100, do you get the same impression?

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100)

#Cut the y-axis off at 10

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100, ylim = c(0,10))

#Restore the y-axis and change the breaks so that they are 0-5, 5-20, 20-25, 25-35

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = c(0,5,20,25,35))

```

## Plots
```{r}
#Plot the number of confusion points against the watch time

plot(D1$confusion.points, D1$watch.time)

#Create two variables x & y
x <- c(1,3,2,7,6,4,4)
y <- c(2,4,2,3,2,4,3)

#Create a table from x & y
table1 <- table(x,y)

#Display the table as a Barplot
barplot(table1)

#Create a data frame of the average total key points for each year and plot the two against each other as a lines

D3 <- D1 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(mean_key = mean(key.points))

plot(D3$year, D3$mean_key, type = "l", lty = "dashed")

#Create a boxplot of total enrollment for three students
D4 <- filter(D1, stid == 4|stid == 20| stid == 22)
#The drop levels command will remove all the schools from the variable with no data  
D4 <- droplevels(D4)
boxplot(D4$watch.time~D4$stid, xlab = "Student", ylab = "Watch Time")
```
## Pairs
```{r}
#Use matrix notation to select columns 2, 5, 6, and 7
D5 <- D1[,c(2,5,6,7)]
#Draw a matrix of plots for every combination of variables
pairs(D5)
```
## Part II

1. Create a simulated data set containing 100 students, each with a score from 1-100 representing performance in an educational game. The scores should tend to cluster around 75. Also, each student should be given a classification that reflects one of four interest groups: sport, music, nature, literature.

```{r}
#rnorm(100, 75, 15) creates a random sample with a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 20
#pmax sets a maximum value, pmin sets a minimum value
#round rounds numbers to whole number values
#sample draws a random samples from the groups vector according to a uniform distribution
set.seed(2020)
a <- rnorm(100,75,15)
a <- pmin(a,100)
a <- pmax(a,1)
score <- round(a)
set.seed(2019)
interest <- factor(sample(c('sport','music', 'nature', 'literature'),100,replace = TRUE))
data <- data.frame(score,interest)
```

2. Using base R commands, draw a histogram of the scores. Change the breaks in your histogram until you think they best represent your data.

```{r}
hist(data$score,breaks = 10,xlab = 'score',main ='Histogram of score' )
```


3. Create a new variable that groups the scores according to the breaks in your histogram.

```{r}
#cut() divides the range of scores into intervals and codes the values in scores according to which interval they fall. We use a vector called `letters` as the labels, `letters` is a vector made up of the letters of the alphabet.
data$scoregroup <- factor(cut(data$score,right=T,breaks=c(0,60,70,80,90,100),labels = F),levels=c(1,2,3,4,5),labels=c('F','D','C','B','A'))

```

4. Now using the colorbrewer package (RColorBrewer; http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) design a pallette and assign it to the groups in your data on the histogram.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
#Let's look at the available palettes in RColorBrewer

#The top section of palettes are sequential, the middle section are qualitative, and the lower section are diverging.
#Make RColorBrewer palette available to R and assign to your bins

#Use named palette in histogram
display.brewer.all()
hist(data$score,breaks=10,xlab = 'score',main ='Histogram of score',col=brewer.pal(8,"Set3") )
```


5. Create a boxplot that visualizes the scores for each interest group and color each interest group a different color.

```{r}
#Make a vector of the colors from RColorBrewer
boxplot(data$score~data$interest,data=data,col=brewer.pal(4,"Set2"))
```


6. Now simulate a new variable that describes the number of logins that students made to the educational game. They should vary from 1-25.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
data$login <- sample(1:25,100,replace = T)
```

7. Plot the relationships between logins and scores. Give the plot a title and color the dots according to interest group.

```{r}
plot(data[,c('login','score')],col=c(4,2,6,3)[data[,c('interest')]],main='Plot of scores to logins')
legend("topleft",fill=c(4,2,6,3),legend=c("literature","music","nature","sport"),title="interest",horiz=TRUE,bty="n",col=grey(.7),cex=.8)
```


8. R contains several inbuilt data sets, one of these in called AirPassengers. Plot a line graph of the the airline passengers over time using this data set.

```{r}
plot(AirPassengers)
```


9. Using another inbuilt data set, iris, plot the relationships between all of the variables in the data set. Which of these relationships is it appropraiet to run a correlation on? 

```{r}
pairs(iris)
#Sepal.Length, Petal.Length and Petal.Width are appropriate to run a correlation on.
```

# Part III - Analyzing Swirl

## Data 

In this repository you will find data describing Swirl activity from the class so far this semester. Please connect RStudio to this repository.

### Instructions
  
1. Insert a new code block
2. Create a data frame from the `swirl-data.csv` file called `DF1`

The variables are:

`course_name` - the name of the R course the student attempted  
`lesson_name` - the lesson name  
`question_number` - the question number attempted
`correct` - whether the question was answered correctly  
`attempt` - how many times the student attempted the question  
`skipped` - whether the student skipped the question  
`datetime` - the date and time the student attempted the question  
`hash` - anonymyzed student ID  
```{r}
DF1 <- read.csv("swirl-data.csv", header = TRUE)
DF1 <- na.omit(DF1)
```

3. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `attempt` called `DF2`
```{r}
DF2 <- data.frame(DF1[,c('hash','lesson_name','attempt')])
``` 

4. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`
```{r}
library(dplyr)
DF3 <- DF2 %>% group_by(lesson_name,hash) %>% summarise(sum=sum(attempt))
```

5. On a scrap piece of paper draw what you think `DF3` would look like if all the lesson names were column names

6. Convert `DF3` to this format  
```{r}
library(nnet)
DF3$lesson_name <- factor(DF3$lesson_name)
dummy <- class.ind(DF3$lesson_name)
DF3$lesson_name=NULL
DF3 <- data.frame(dummy,DF3)
```

7. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `correct`
```{r}
DF4 <- data.frame(DF1[,c('hash','lesson_name','correct')])
```

8. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0`  
```{r}
DF4$correct <- factor(DF4$correct,levels=c('FALSE','TRUE'),labels = c(0,1))
```

9. Create a new data frame called `DF5` that provides a mean score for each student on each course
```{r}
DF1$correct <- as.numeric(factor(DF1$correct,levels=c('FALSE','TRUE'),labels = c(0,1)))-1
DF5 <- DF1 %>% group_by(course_name,hash) %>% summarise(meanscore=sum(correct))

```

10. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF6`) that shows the average correct for each day
```{r}
DF1 <- DF1[-c(740,1971,1206,3464,2687,2660),]
DF1$datetime <- as.POSIXct(as.numeric(DF1$datetime),tz='UTC',origin='1970-1-1')
DF1$date <- factor(as.Date(DF1$datetime))
DF6 <- DF1 %>% group_by(DF1$date) %>% summarise(sum=sum(correct))
```
