#Part I

## Data Wrangling
In the hackathon a project was proposed to collect data from student video watching, a sample of this data is available in the file video-data.csv.

stid = student id
year = year student watched video
participation = whether or not the student opened the video
watch.time = how long the student watched the video for
confusion.points = how many times a student rewatched a section of a video
key,points = how many times a student skipped or increased the speed of a video

```{r}
#Install the 'tidyverse' package or if that does not work, install the 'dplyr' and 'tidyr' packages.


#Load the package(s) you just installed

library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

D1 <- read.csv("video-data.csv", header = TRUE)


#Create a data frame that only contains the years 2018
D2 <- filter(D1, year == 2018)
```

## Histograms
```{r}
#Generate a histogram of the watch time for the year 2018

hist(D2$watch.time)

#Change the number of breaks to 100, do you get the same impression?

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100)

#Cut the y-axis off at 10

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100, ylim = c(0,10))

#Restore the y-axis and change the breaks so that they are 0-5, 5-20, 20-25, 25-35

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = c(0,5,20,25,35))

```

## Plots
```{r}
#Plot the number of confusion points against the watch time


plot(D1$confusion.points, D1$watch.time)

#Create two variables x & y
x <- c(1,3,2,7,6,4,4)
y <- c(2,4,2,3,2,4,3)

#Create a table from x & y
table1 <- table(x,y)
table1
#Display the table as a Barplot
barplot(table1)

#Create a data frame of the average total key points for each year and plot the two against each other as a lines

D3 <- D1 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(mean_key = mean(key.points))

plot(D3$year, D3$mean_key, type = "l", lty = "dashed")

#Create a boxplot of total enrollment for three students
D4 <- filter(D1, stid == 4|stid == 20| stid == 22)

#The drop levels command will remove all the schools from the variable with no data  
D4 <- droplevels(D4)

boxplot(D4$watch.time~D4$stid, xlab = "Student", ylab = "Watch Time")
```
## Pairs
```{r}
#Use matrix notation to select columns 2, 5, 6, and 7
D5 <- D1[,c(2,5,6,7)]

#Draw a matrix of plots for every combination of variables
pairs(D5)
```
## Part II

1. Create a simulated data set containing 100 students, each with a score from 1-100 representing performance in an educational game. The scores should tend to cluster around 75. Also, each student should be given a classification that reflects one of four interest groups: sport, music, nature, literature.

```{r}
#rnorm(100, 75, 15) creates a random sample with a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 20
#filter() can be used to set a maximum and minimum value
#round() rounds numbers to whole number values
#sample() draws a random samples from the groups vector according to a uniform distribution

set.seed(1)
stu_id = seq(1,100,1)

classification = factor(c("sport","music","nature","literature"))
stu_scores = round(rnorm(100,75,15))

stu_scores[which(stu_scores>100)]=100

stu_classification = sample(classification,100,T)
student_df = data.frame(stu_id,stu_scores,stu_classification)
head(student_df,10)
```

2. Using base R commands, draw a histogram of the scores. Change the breaks in your histogram until you think they best represent your data.

```{r}

hist(student_df$stu_scores,breaks=c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100),main='Histogram of the scores',xlab = "Range of students' scores",ylim=c(0,30))


```


3. Create a new variable that groups the scores according to the breaks in your histogram.

```{r}
#cut() divides the range of scores into intervals and codes the values in scores according to which interval they fall. We use a vector called `letters` as the labels, `letters` is a vector made up of the letters of the alphabet.
stu_scores_cut = cut(student_df$stu_scores,breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),ordered_result = T,labels = c('F','D','C','B','A'))
student_df$breaks = stu_scores_cut
head(student_df,10)

```

4. Now using the colorbrewer package (RColorBrewer; http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) design a pallette and assign it to the groups in your data on the histogram.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
#Let's look at the available palettes in RColorBrewer

#The top section of palettes are sequential, the middle section are qualitative, and the lower section are diverging.
#Make RColorBrewer palette available to R and assign to your bins
display.brewer.all()
#Use named palette in histogram

scores_colors = brewer.pal(11,"RdBu")
hist(student_df$stu_scores,breaks=c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100),main='Histogram of the scores',xlab = "Range of students' scores",ylim=c(0,30),col = scores_colors)
```


5. Create a boxplot that visualizes the scores for each interest group and color each interest group a different color.

```{r}
#Make a vector of the colors from RColorBrewer
interest_group_colors = brewer.pal(9,'Set1')
boxplot(student_df$stu_scores~student_df$stu_classification,xlab = "Interesting groups", ylab = "Scores",col=interest_group_colors)

```


6. Now simulate a new variable that describes the number of logins that students made to the educational game. They should vary from 1-25.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
num_of_logins = sample(1:25,100,T)
student_df$stu_num_of_logins = num_of_logins
head(student_df,10)

```

7. Plot the relationships between logins and scores. Give the plot a title and color the dots according to interest group.

```{r}
plot(student_df$stu_scores~student_df$stu_num_of_logins,xlab = "Num of logins", ylab = "Scores",main='The relationships between logins and scores',col=c("red","blue","yellow","green")[student_df$stu_classification])
legend("topleft",fill=c("red","blue","yellow","green"),horiz=TRUE,c("sport","music","nature","literature"),title="interest group",bty= 'n')
```


8. R contains several inbuilt data sets, one of these in called AirPassengers. Plot a line graph of the the airline passengers over time using this data set.

```{r}
plot(AirPassengers,type = "o",pch=20)

```


9. Using another inbuilt data set, iris, plot the relationships between all of the variables in the data set. Which of these relationships is it appropraiet to run a correlation on? 

```{r}
pairs(iris)

```

# Part III - Analyzing Swirl

## Data 

In this repository you will find data describing Swirl activity from the class so far this semester. Please connect RStudio to this repository.

### Instructions
  
1. Insert a new code block
2. Create a data frame from the `swirl-data.csv` file called `DF1`


The variables are:

`course_name` - the name of the R course the student attempted  
`lesson_name` - the lesson name  
`question_number` - the question number attempted
`correct` - whether the question was answered correctly  
`attempt` - how many times the student attempted the question  
`skipped` - whether the student skipped the question  
`datetime` - the date and time the student attempted the question  
`hash` - anonymyzed student ID  

```{r}

DF1= read.csv(
  'swirl-data.csv',
  head = T
)
head(DF1,10)

```


3. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `attempt` called `DF2`
```{r}
DF2 = DF1[,c(8,2,5)]
head(DF2,10)

```


4. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`

```{r}
DF3 <- DF2 %>%group_by(hash,lesson_name)%>%summarise(
attempts=sum(attempt)
)
head(DF3,10)

```


5. On a scrap piece of paper draw what you think `DF3` would look like if all the lesson names were column names


6. Convert `DF3` to this format  

```{r}

DF3 = spread(DF3,lesson_name,attempts)
head(DF3,10)

```


7. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `correct`

```{r}
DF4 = DF1[,c(8,2,4)]
head(DF4,10)

```

8. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0`  
```{r}


DF4$correct = as.integer(as.logical(DF4$correct))
head(DF4,10)



```



9. Create a new data frame called `DF5` that provides a mean score for each student on each course

```{r}
temp_df = DF1[,c("hash","course_name","lesson_name","question_number","correct")]
temp_df = filter(temp_df, correct == 'TRUE')
head(temp_df,10)
temp_df = temp_df %>%group_by(hash,course_name,lesson_name) %>%summarise(score = n())
head(temp_df,10)


DF5 <- temp_df %>% group_by(hash, course_name) %>% summarise(mean.score = round(mean(score)))
head(DF5,5)


```



10. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF6`) that shows the average correct for each day
