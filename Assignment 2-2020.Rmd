#Part I

## Data Wrangling
In the hackathon a project was proposed to collect data from student video watching, a sample of this data is available in the file video-data.csv.

stid = student id
year = year student watched video
participation = whether or not the student opened the video
watch.time = how long the student watched the video for
confusion.points = how many times a student rewatched a section of a video
key,points = how many times a student skipped or increased the speed of a video

```{r}
#Install the 'tidyverse' package or if that does not work, install the 'dplyr' and 'tidyr' packages.

#Load the package(s) you just installed

library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

D1 <- read.csv("video-data.csv", header = TRUE)

#Create a data frame that only contains the years 2018
D2 <- filter(D1, year == 2018)
```

## Histograms
```{r}
#Generate a histogram of the watch time for the year 2018

hist(D2$watch.time)

#Change the number of breaks to 100, do you get the same impression?

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100)

#Cut the y-axis off at 10

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100, ylim = c(0,10))

#Restore the y-axis and change the breaks so that they are 0-5, 5-20, 20-25, 25-35

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = c(0,5,20,25,35))

```

## Plots
```{r}
#Plot the number of confusion points against the watch time

plot(D1$confusion.points, D1$watch.time)

#Create two variables x & y
x <- c(1,3,2,7,6,4,4)
y <- c(2,4,2,3,2,4,3)

#Create a table from x & y
table1 <- table(x,y)

#Display the table as a Barplot
barplot(table1)

#Create a data frame of the average total key points for each year and plot the two against each other as a lines

D3 <- D1 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(mean_key = mean(key.points)) %>% print

plot(D3$year, D3$mean_key, type = "l", lty = "dashed")

#Create a boxplot of total enrollment for three students
D4 <- filter(D1, stid == 4|stid == 20| stid == 22)
#The drop levels command will remove all the schools from the variable with no data  
D4 <- droplevels(D4)
boxplot(D4$watch.time~D4$stid, xlab = "Student", ylab = "Watch Time")
```
## Pairs
```{r}
#Use matrix notation to select columns 2, 5, 6, and 7
D5 <- D1[,c(2,5,6,7)]
#Draw a matrix of plots for every combination of variables
pairs(D5)
```
## Part II
1. Create a simulated data set containing 100 students, each with a score from 1-100 representing performance in an educational game. The scores should tend to cluster around 75. Also, each student should be given a classification that reflects one of four interest groups: sport, music, nature, literature.

```{r}
#rnorm(100, 75, 15) creates a random sample with a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 20
#filter() can be used to set a maximum and minimum value
#round() rounds numbers to whole number values
#sample() draws a random samples from the groups vector according to a uniform distribution

set.seed(1)
s <-rep(NA,100)
for(i in 1:100){
  repeat{
        s[i]<-round(rnorm(1,mean=75,sd=20))
        if(s[i]<=100 && s[i]>=0) break
    }
}

set.seed(2)
m <- rep(NA,100)
for(i in 1:100){
  repeat{
        m[i]<-round(rnorm(1,mean=75,sd=20))
        if(m[i]<=100 && m[i]>=0) break
    }
}

set.seed(3)
n <-rep(NA,100)
for(i in 1:100){
  repeat{
        n[i]<-round(rnorm(1,mean=75,sd=20))
        if(n[i]<=100 && n[i]>=0) break
    }
}

set.seed(4)
l <-rep(NA,100)
for(i in 1:100){
  repeat{
        l[i]<-round(rnorm(1,mean=75,sd=20))
        if(l[i]<=100 && l[i]>=0) break
    }
}


performance <- data.frame(
  sport = s,
  music= m,
  nature = n,
  literature = l)

performance

```

2. Using base R commands, draw a histogram of the scores. Change the breaks in your histogram until you think they best represent your data.

```{r}
hist(s, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Sport")
hist(m, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Music")
hist(n, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Nature")
hist(l, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Literature")
```


3. Create a new variable that groups the scores according to the breaks in your histogram.

```{r}
#cut() divides the range of scores into intervals and codes the values in scores according to which interval they fall. We use a vector called `letters` as the labels, `letters` is a vector made up of the letters of the alphabet.
scut <- cut(s,breaks=c(0,60,70,80,90,100),labels = c("F","D","C","B","A"))
scut
mcut <- cut(m,breaks=c(0,60,70,80,90,100),labels = c("F","D","C","B","A"))
mcut
ncut <- cut(n,breaks=c(0,60,70,80,90,100),labels = c("F","D","C","B","A"))
ncut
lcut <- cut(l,breaks=c(0,60,70,80,90,100),labels = c("F","D","C","B","A"))
lcut
```

4. Now using the colorbrewer package (RColorBrewer; http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) design a pallette and assign it to the groups in your data on the histogram.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
#Let's look at the available palettes in RColorBrewer

#The top section of palettes are sequential, the middle section are qualitative, and the lower section are diverging.
#Make RColorBrewer palette available to R and assign to your bins

#Use named palette in histogram
hist(s, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Sport", col=brewer.pal(5,"Blues"))
hist(m, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Music", col=brewer.pal(5,"Greens"))
hist(n, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Nature", col=brewer.pal(5,"Greys"))
hist(l, breaks = c(0,60,70,80,90,100),main="Histogram of Literature", col=brewer.pal(5,"Reds"))
```


5. Create a boxplot that visualizes the scores for each interest group and color each interest group a different color.

```{r}
#Make a vector of the colors from RColorBrewer
boxplot(performance, data = performance, xlab = "Interest Groups", ylab = "Scores", col=brewer.pal(4,"Spectral"))
```


6. Now simulate a new variable that describes the number of logins that students made to the educational game. They should vary from 1-25.

```{r}
logins = sample(1:25,100,replace=TRUE)
logins
```

7. Plot the relationships between logins and scores. Give the plot a title and color the dots according to interest group.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

df <- data.frame(logins = logins, Sport = s, Music = m, Nature = n, Literature = l)

plotdf <- melt(df, id.vars = "logins")
print(ggplot(plotdf, aes(value, logins, colour = variable)) + geom_point() + 
        ggtitle(paste0("Plot of Login Times and Scores of Performance")) +
        theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
        guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)))

```

```{r}
library(hrbrthemes)
ggplot(df, aes(x=logins, y=s, alpha=scut)) + 
       geom_point(size=1, color = ("Red")) +
       theme_ipsum() +
       ggtitle("Plot of Login Times and Scores of Sport") +
       xlab("Login times") + ylab("Score of Sport")

ggplot(df, aes(x=logins, y=m, alpha=mcut)) + 
       geom_point(size=1, color="green") +
       theme_ipsum() +
       ggtitle("Plot of Login Times and Scores of Music") +
       xlab("Login times") + ylab("Score of Music")

ggplot(df, aes(x=logins, y=n, alpha=ncut)) + 
       geom_point(size=1, color="blue") +
       theme_ipsum() +
       ggtitle("Plot of Login Times and Scores of Nature") +
       xlab("Login times") + ylab("Score of Nature")

ggplot(df, aes(x=logins, y=l, alpha=lcut)) + 
       geom_point(size=1, color="purple") +
       theme_ipsum() +
       ggtitle("Plot of Login Times and Scores of Literature") +
       xlab("Login times") + ylab("Score of Literature")
```


8. R contains several inbuilt data sets, one of these in called AirPassengers. Plot a line graph of the the airline passengers over time using this data set.

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
air <- AirPassengers
plot(air, ylab="Passengers (1000s)", type="o")
```


9. Using another inbuilt data set, iris, plot the relationships between all of the variables in the data set. Which of these relationships is it appropriate to run a correlation on? 

```{r}
data("iris")
ir = iris
ir

plot(ir)

pairs(iris[1:4], main="Plot of Iris - 3 Species", pch=21, bg = c("Mediumvioletred", "lightpink", "plum")[unclass(iris$Species)])


panel.pearson <- function(x, y, ...) {
horizontal <- (par("usr")[1] + par("usr")[2]) / 2;
vertical <- (par("usr")[3] + par("usr")[4]) / 2;
text(horizontal, vertical, format(abs(cor(x,y)), digits=2))
}

pairs(iris[1:4], main = "Plot of Iris - Pearson", pch = 21, bg = c("Mediumvioletred", "lightpink", "plum")[unclass(iris$Species)], upper.panel=panel.pearson)
#Thus, The correlation coefficient of Sepal length and Sepal Width is -0.12, which indicate that Sepal length and Sepal Width has negative correlate relationship. 

#The correlation coefficient between Petal Length and Petal Width is 0.96, thus, Petal Length and Petal Width have stronger correlation relationship.
```

# Part III - Analyzing Swirl

## Data 

In this repository you will find data describing Swirl activity from the class so far this semester. Please connect RStudio to this repository.

### Instructions
  
1. Insert a new code block
```{r}
```
2. Create a data frame from the `swirl-data.csv` file called `DF1`

The variables are:

`course_name` - the name of the R course the student attempted  
`lesson_name` - the lesson name  
`question_number` - the question number attempted
`correct` - whether the question was answered correctly  
`attempt` - how many times the student attempted the question  
`skipped` - whether the student skipped the question  
`datetime` - the date and time the student attempted the question  
`hash` - anonymyzed student ID  
```{r}
DF1 <- read.csv("swirl-data.csv", header = TRUE)
DF1
```
3. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `attempt` called `DF2`
```{r}
DF2 <- DF1 %>% select(hash,lesson_name,attempt)
DF2
```
4. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`
```{r}
DF3 <- DF2 %>% group_by(hash, lesson_name) %>% summarize(total=sum(attempt)) %>%print
```
5. On a scrap piece of paper draw what you think `DF3` would look like if all the lesson names were column names
6. Convert `DF3` to this format  
```{r}
DF3 <- DF2 %>% group_by(hash, lesson_name) %>% summarise(attempt = sum(attempt))
DF3S <- spread(DF3, lesson_name, attempt)
DF3S
```
7. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `correct`
```{r}
DF4 <- DF1 %>% select(hash, lesson_name, correct)
DF4
```
8. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0`  
```{r}
DF4$correct <- ifelse(DF4$correct == TRUE, 1, 0)
DF4
```

9. Create a new data frame called `DF5` that provides a mean score for each student on each course
```{r}
DF5 <- DF4 %>% group_by(hash, lesson_name) %>% summarise(mean.correct = mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE))
DF5
```

10. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF6`) that shows the average correct for each day
```{r}
DF6  <- DF1 %>% select(datetime, correct) %>% mutate(correct=as.logical(correct))%>% mutate(correct=as.numeric(correct))%>% mutate(datetime= format(as.POSIXct(datetime,origin = "1970-01-01"), "%B %d %Y")) %>% group_by(datetime) %>% summarize(mean_correct=mean(correct, na.rm=TRUE))  %>% print
```
