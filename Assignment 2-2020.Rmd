#Part I

## Data Wrangling
In the hackathon a project was proposed to collect data from student video watching, a sample of this data is available in the file video-data.csv.

stid = student id
year = year student watched video
participation = whether or not the student opened the video
watch.time = how long the student watched the video for
confusion.points = how many times a student rewatched a section of a video
key,points = how many times a student skipped or increased the speed of a video

```{r}
#Install the 'tidyverse' package or if that does not work, install the 'dplyr' and 'tidyr' packages.

#Load the package(s) you just installed

library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

D1 <- read.csv("video-data.csv", header = TRUE)

#Create a data frame that only contains the years 2018
D2 <- filter(D1, year == 2018)
```

## Histograms
```{r}
#Generate a histogram of the watch time for the year 2018

hist(D2$watch.time)

#Change the number of breaks to 100, do you get the same impression?

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100)

#Cut the y-axis off at 10

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = 100, ylim = c(0,10))

#Restore the y-axis and change the breaks so that they are 0-5, 5-20, 20-25, 25-35

hist(D2$watch.time, breaks = c(0,5,20,25,35))

```

## Plots
```{r}
#Plot the number of confusion points against the watch time

plot(D1$confusion.points, D1$watch.time)

#Create two variables x & y
x <- c(1,3,2,7,6,4,4)
y <- c(2,4,2,3,2,4,3)

#Create a table from x & y
table1 <- table(x,y)

#Display the table as a Barplot
barplot(table1)

#Create a data frame of the average total key points for each year and plot the two against each other as a lines

D3 <- D1 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(mean_key = mean(key.points))

plot(D3$year, D3$mean_key, type = "l", lty = "dashed")

#Create a boxplot of total enrollment for three students
D4 <- filter(D1, stid == 4|stid == 20| stid == 22)
#The drop levels command will remove all the schools from the variable with no data  
D4 <- droplevels(D4)
boxplot(D4$watch.time~D4$stid, xlab = "Student", ylab = "Watch Time")
```
## Pairs
```{r}
#Use matrix notation to select columns 2, 5, 6, and 7
D5 <- D1[,c(2,5,6,7)]
#Draw a matrix of plots for every combination of variables
pairs(D5)
```
## Part II

1. Create a simulated data set containing 100 students, each with a score from 1-100 representing performance in an educational game. The scores should tend to cluster around 75. Also, each student should be given a classification that reflects one of four interest groups: sport, music, nature, literature.

```{r}
#rnorm(100, 75, 15) creates a random sample with a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 20
#filter() can be used to set a maximum and minimum value
#round rounds numbers to whole number values
#sample draws a random samples from the groups vector according to a uniform distribution

score <- rnorm(100, 75, 15)
D1 <- data.frame(score)
D1 <- filter(D1, score <= 100) 
D2 <- data.frame(rep(100,3)) 
names(D2) <- "score" 
D3 <- bind_rows(D1,D2)
D3$score <- sample(D3$score, 100)
D3$score <- round(D3$score)
D3$interest <- sample(c("sports", "music", "nature", "literature"), 100, replace = TRUE)
D3$stid <- seq(1,100,1)

```

2. Using base R commands, draw a histogram of the scores. Change the breaks in your histogram until you think they best represent your data.

```{r}
hist(D3$score)
hist(D3$score, breaks = 13, xlab = "Scores", main = "Histogram of Scores")

```


3. Create a new variable that groups the scores according to the breaks in your histogram.

```{r}
#cut() divides the range of scores into intervals and codes the values in scores according to which interval they fall. We use a vector called `letters` as the labels, `letters` is a vector made up of the letters of the alphabet.

D3$letters <- cut(D3$score, breaks = 13, labels = letters[1:13])

```

4. Now using the colorbrewer package (RColorBrewer; http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) design a pallette and assign it to the groups in your data on the histogram.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
#Let's look at the available palettes in RColorBrewer

#The top section of palettes are sequential, the middle section are qualitative, and the lower section are diverging.
#Make RColorBrewer palette available to R and assign to your bins

#Use named palette in histogram 
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
hist(D3$score, breaks = 13, xlab = "Scores", main = "Histogram of Scores", col = brewer.pal(12,"Paired"))

```


5. Create a boxplot that visualizes the scores for each interest group and color each interest group a different color.

```{r}
#Make a vector of the colors from RColorBrewer 
colors <- c(brewer.pal(4,"BrBG"))
boxplot(D3$score~D3$interest, xlab = "Interests", ylab = "Scores", main = "Bloxplot of interests vs scores", col = colors)

```


6. Now simulate a new variable that describes the number of logins that students made to the educational game. They should vary from 1-25.

```{r}
D3$logins <- sample(1:25, 100, replace = TRUE)

```

7. Plot the relationships between logins and scores. Give the plot a title and color the dots according to interest group.

```{r}
plot(D3$login, D3$score, col = colors, xlab = "Number of Logins", ylab = "Scores", main = "Student Logins vs. Scores")

```


8. R contains several inbuilt data sets, one of these in called AirPassengers. Plot a line graph of the the airline passengers over time using this data set.

```{r}

plot(AirPassengers, type = "l")

```


9. Using another inbuilt data set, iris, plot the relationships between all of the variables in the data set. Which of these relationships is it appropraiet to run a correlation on? 

```{r}
pairs(iris)
#Answer: all the variables except species are appropriate to run correlations on
```

# Part III - Analyzing Swirl

## Data 

In this repository you will find data describing Swirl activity from the class so far this semester. Please connect RStudio to this repository.

### Instructions
  
1. Insert a new code block
2. Create a data frame from the `swirl-data.csv` file called `DF1`
```{r}
DF1 <- read.csv("swirl-data.csv", head = TRUE)

```

The variables are:

`course_name` - the name of the R course the student attempted  
`lesson_name` - the lesson name  
`question_number` - the question number attempted
`correct` - whether the question was answered correctly  
`attempt` - how many times the student attempted the question  
`skipped` - whether the student skipped the question  
`datetime` - the date and time the student attempted the question  
`hash` - anonymyzed student ID  

3. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `attempt` called `DF2`
```{r}
DF2 <- DF1[,c(2,5,8)]

```

4. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`
```{r}

DF3 <- DF2 %>% group_by(lesson_name, hash) %>% summarise(attempt = sum(attempt))
DF3 <- DF3[complete.cases(DF3), ]

```

5. On a scrap piece of paper draw what you think `DF3` would look like if all the lesson names were column names

6. Convert `DF3` to this format  
```{r}

DF_3 <- DF3 %>% pivot_wider(names_from = lesson_name, values_from = attempt)
DF_3
                     
```


7. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and `correct`
```{r}

DF4 <- DF1[,c(2,4,8)]

```

8. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0`  
```{r}
DF4$correct <- sapply(DF4$correct, function(x) {
  as.numeric(x)
})

DF4$correct[DF4$correct == 3] <- 1
DF4$correct[DF4$correct == 2] <- 0


```


9. Create a new data frame called `DF5` that provides a mean score for each student on each course

```{r}
DF4 <- DF4[complete.cases(DF4), ]
DF5 <- DF4 %>% group_by(lesson_name, hash) %>% summarise(score = mean(correct))
DF5 <- DF5 %>% pivot_wider(names_from = lesson_name, values_from = score)
DF5

```


10. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF6`) that shows the average correct for each day

```{r}
DF6 <- DF1[,c(2,4,7,8)]
DF6$datetime <- as.POSIXct(DF6$datetime,origin="1970-01-01")
DF6$datetime <- as.Date(as.POSIXct(DF6$datetime, "EST"))

DF6$correct <- sapply(DF6$correct, function(x) {
  as.numeric(x)
})

DF6$correct[DF6$correct == 3] <- 1
DF6$correct[DF6$correct == 2] <- 0

DF6 <- DF6[complete.cases(DF6), ]
DF6 <- DF6 %>% group_by(datetime) %>% summarise(score = mean(correct))
DF6

```
